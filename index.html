        Slow Motion is an intimate, high fidelity, 3-day retreat celebrating music, 
        dance and 9 years of community at Second Hand Records. It’s an extension of 
        Musicland, where we can explore beyond the confines of our home in Brooklyn.

            We were sure Camp Hope was the right space for Slow Motion when we learned of its ties back to the Paradise Garage - our own doorkeeper Angel worked there with a swath of club alumni in ’87.

        <h4>Slow Motion is about moving together, with care</h4>
        <p>
            Let’s build a space where everyone can feel good, free, and welcome. 
            That means looking out for each other, being mindful of boundaries, and keeping the energy kind and open. 
            Say hi to others!

        <h4>Leave no trace</h4>
        <p>
            Treat Camp Hope like a home and leave it as we found it—clean, cared for, and beautiful. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            That means cleaning up after yourself: cigarette butts, cans, cups, and trash all need to go in the right place. 
            Don’t leave anything behind at your cabin or around the grounds.
        </p>

                Yes! Instead of reserving a meal plan, you can request to reserve a spot in the dining hall kitchen to prepare your own meals. Space is limited, so reservations are required.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There’s also a shared outdoor grill available to all guests, first-come first-served.

                <br/>
                There are bears! Any food or snacks must be stored in the dining hall or in a sealed container / cooler.

                <br/>
                All ticket sales are final and non-refundable—this helps us cover fixed costs and keeps ticket prices as low as possible. However, we do offer ticket transfers:
                <ul>
                    <li>You may transfer your ticket to someone else by <a href="mailto:slowmotionweekender@gmail.com" title="mailto:slowmotionweekender@gmail.com">contacting us </a>at least 7 days before Slow Motion with the recipient’s full name and email address.</li>
                    <li>If you’d like to upgrade your ticket (e.g., from General Admission to All-In), you can do so through your Slow Motion account or by <a href="mailto:slowmotionweekender@gmail.com" title="mailto:slowmotionweekender@gmail.com">contacting us</a>. </li>
                </ul>
                Availability may be limited, so we recommend requesting changes early.
